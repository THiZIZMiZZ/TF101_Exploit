TF101_Exploit
=============
Basically this is just a Linux kernel exploit in version 2.6.39 or above which was found by JÃ¼ri Aedla.
Anyway Saurik went ahead and used the exploit to root a Galaxy Nexus android phone. Since I have an 
Asus Transformer TF101 that I recently updated to ICS 4.0.3 (which runs Linux Kernal 2.6.39) I decided to give
it a shot and use the exploit to gain root access. Good news, it worked. Even better news, it can be used 
with OTA root keeper. 

Sauriks explanation on how it works:
"So, a major requirement for this exploit to work is to find a setuid program that writes something deterministic 
to a file descriptor, and it turns out that the only setuid program available on stock Android (run-as) just so 
happens to have exactly that behavior: you give it the name of a package, and if it doesn't exist it echos it to stderr.
Unfortunately, run-as is statically linked, so you can't do any simple tricks to find the exit() symbol in the program. 
I therefore looked it up with a disassembler. I could probably write some kind of auto-detector for the required 
offsets if people find this to actually be of use (i.e., it is important or usable on some device).
Further, run-as bails early on if it is not either a) already running as root (which would defeat the purpose) 
or b) not running as the adb shell user, so this unfortunately cannot be integrated into a "one-click root" app. 
You therefore already need working adb shell access to the device in order to install/run this program and escalate 
to root."

So I included the Sauriks code used in the exploit and a compiled version.
The instructions are on the uncompiled versin of the file.
here is the command used with the Transformer TF101 "./mempodroid 0xd7f4 0xad4b mount -o remount,rw '' /system"

Have fun :)
